# Autonomous Navigation using QLearning
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

## Overview

The module will be able to train a robot to navigate autonomously in a completely unknown environment by avoiding obstacles using Q-learning technique. A model world will be simulated in Gazebo and the robot will be allowed to navigate in it without any knowledge about the world. A positive reward is given to states clear of obstacles while negative reward is given to states that is proportional to the proximity of an obstacle. The robot is allowed to navigate the world repeatedly until Q value table is updated to achieve an optimal policy. With the help of the Q table generated, the robot can navigate in any other random world/environment by avoiding obstacles.
